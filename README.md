1) **Movie Rating App** - A simple application where a user can add new movies and vote for other movies present on the website. The movies are sorted in a descending order of the number of votes and weighted votes are also taken into consideration.

2) **Social Login App** - This application lets users make an account on the site using facebook, twitter or github instead of using email. The feature has been developed using the omniauth ruby gem.
